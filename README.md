# Awajun-OP
We introduce a Spanish-Awajun parallel dataset of 22k sentence pairs. This dataset consists of parallel data obtained from various web sources such as poems, stories, laws, protocols, guidelines, handbooks, the Bible, and news published by Ojo PÃºblico. The study also includes an analysis of the dataset's performance for Spanish-Awajun translation.
